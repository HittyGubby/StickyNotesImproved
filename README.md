## **Improved windows 7 sticky notes!**

Bro windows 7 sticky notes is terrible tbh

First its not sticked to top! how could you call that ***sticky*** ??

And it appears on the taskbar which makes me 1000% wanna ***close* *it***

So i make it **disappear on taskbar**

And **sticked to the top**!! woohoo!

Welp it actually works like a launcher, still need sticky notes files (StikyNot.exe/StikyNot.exe.mui) in your System32, so if you want to replace the executable with sticky notes, modify the file paths in code to your StikyNot.exe and put the launcher file containing folder into PATH variable or just change the start menu shortcut address, anyways it's depending on you :)

(Planned to add dark mode for it since its light colors are rly bad for users who like dark mode, wait for next version :)
